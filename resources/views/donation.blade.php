      <h5 class="card-title">Donating is a selfless act</h5>
      <p class="card-text">How often do you donate? Maybe to a person, you donâ€™t know or you know. In the world of today, 
          everyone has a story. The raise of calamity, pandemic, loss of a job, and inadequate resources. 
          This makes a lot of people dependent on government or anyone who can give them something to eat, wear and at least see the following day. 
          How may time does the donation reach the targeted person in the middle and how do you track how you change someone living in another continent or country?
        </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">AidPedia gives that platform</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The answer is here, imagine giving that donation and confirming it reaches the intended person, 
          see their life change and they can smile once more. AidPedia gives that platform, you list the donation and the target group. 
          The target group applies and the organization donates choose who qualifies for the donation. 
          The donation is released and the organization can track how they are changing lives.
