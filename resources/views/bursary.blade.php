      <h5 class="card-title">Why Bursary?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">In modern society, most of the students and great leader canâ€™t be where they are if they did not get a bursary. 
          Education in the third world is expensive and most students cannot raise the money. They depend on bursary and well-wishers to be in class. 
          Most organizations have a bursary for the less fortunate, but the issue is how it is distributed. They have to depend on a third-party organization or institution. 
          The organization chooses who gives and who not to give and how connected they are to the candidate.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">For Candidates</h5>
      <p class="card-text">This has left a lot of qualified candidates not to access bursary which they dearly need to finish their education. 
          AidPedia is an organization helping students apply the Bursary direct from the organization without a third party. 
          The organization is screened before they are listed and the participant can be traced to a humble background.
         The organization also monitors student education, progress, and all the needed information about the students. 
         They can evaluate how the bursary was used and who to hold accountable.
