      <h5 class="card-title">Giving Back to Society</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Most organizations have a way to give back to society, whether through education, feeding the hungry, or supporting the victims. 
          This organization has to go to another organization to help with information on who to give or not. Some of the businesses or organizations apply 
          for grant but it canâ€™t be accounted for. They discriminate against who to give, when, and the relationship. 
          The organization may depend on the government to distribute the grants but how effective are the process and outcome?</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Applying for a Grant</h5>
      <p class="card-text">AidPedia is the answer, a candidate will be able to apply for grants directly to the organization. 
          The organization will be defining who the grant is for, timeline, and request all the required data, information, and proof. 
          The grant will be automatically released to the qualified candidates, not from the third company or organization but to the intended users.</p>
